        <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <b>1500s</b>, 
	when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
	It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
	<ins>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</ins>
